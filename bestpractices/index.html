<h3>Line Spacing</h3>
<p> Rules for line spacing:
    Aim for about 140%-180% for optimal readability and accessibility. Any smaller and the text will be cramped and difficult to read. Go much larger and the eye can get lost.
    
    Limit line length to 70-80 characters. Longer lines of text can confuse the eye, particularly when reading text on a screen. If you must use longer lines, increase the line spacing to help protect readability.
    
    Font size should be minimum 16pt. This long-standing rule of thumb still applies. Most of the time. In apps for bigger displays like TVs, you will need to go to about 32pt.
   
    Small fonts need more spacing. Line spacing as a % should actually increase with smaller font sizes. This is because smaller fonts are already more difficult to read, and need more space around them for the eye to easily follow.
    
    Experiment with tighter spacing on pull quotes or other short texts. If typography is mostly about how we present language in text form for optimal readability, it’s also partly about beautiful avant-garde design. If you want to play with less line space, stick to pull quotes and similar shorter text areas.
   
    Check your line spacing when you change font or font size. Different fonts have different maximum heights (x-heights) even when they’re the same size in points. So you need to be sure that when you change font, you check to see how your line spacing feels in readability terms.

<h4>Table Style</h4>
<p>
    1. Choose The Best Row Style
Row style helps users scan, read, and parse through data. Choose the best style for the type and amount of data in your table.
Grid: Including both horizontal and vertical lines provides the most separation between data points, but the excess visual noise can be distracting. This spreadsheet-style is recommended for dense, data heavy tables.

Horizontal Lines: Only showing horizontal lines reduces the visual noise of a full grid. This style includes plenty of white space while still helping the user keep their place while reading. This style is the most common and recommended for all data set sizes.
</p>

<p>2. Use Clear Contrast
   
    Header Contrast: Differentiate header text from column text by changing the weight and color. Applying a different color background to the header can provide additional contrast if desired.
    Column data: Column data can also use different weights and colors to emphasize certain data like the row identifier (first column) or a primary data point in a single cell (ie. cell data: 1,234 34%).
