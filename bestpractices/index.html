<h3 style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans', 'Lucida Sans Regular', 'Lucida Grande', 'Lucida Sans Unicode', Geneva, Verdana, sans-serif">Line Spacing</h3>
<p style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans', 'Lucida Sans Regular', 'Lucida Grande', 'Lucida Sans Unicode', Geneva, Verdana, sans-serif"> Rules for line spacing:
    Aim for about 140%-180% for optimal readability and accessibility. Any smaller and the text will be cramped and difficult to read. Go much larger and the eye can get lost.
    
    Limit line length to 70-80 characters. Longer lines of text can confuse the eye, particularly when reading text on a screen. If you must use longer lines, increase the line spacing to help protect readability.
    
    Font size should be minimum 16pt. This long-standing rule of thumb still applies. Most of the time. In apps for bigger displays like TVs, you will need to go to about 32pt.
   
    Small fonts need more spacing. Line spacing as a % should actually increase with smaller font sizes. This is because smaller fonts are already more difficult to read, and need more space around them for the eye to easily follow.
    
    Experiment with tighter spacing on pull quotes or other short texts. If typography is mostly about how we present language in text form for optimal readability, it’s also partly about beautiful avant-garde design. If you want to play with less line space, stick to pull quotes and similar shorter text areas.
   
    Check your line spacing when you change font or font size. Different fonts have different maximum heights (x-heights) even when they’re the same size in points. So you need to be sure that when you change font, you check to see how your line spacing feels in readability terms.

<p  style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans', 'Lucida Sans Regular', 'Lucida Grande', 'Lucida Sans Unicode', Geneva, Verdana, sans-serif">
    1. Choose The Best Row Style
    Row style helps users scan, read, and parse through data. Choose the best style for the type and amount of data in your table.
Grid: Including both horizontal and vertical lines provides the most separation between data points, but the excess visual noise can be distracting. This spreadsheet-style is recommended for dense, data heavy tables.
Horizontal Lines: Only showing horizontal lines reduces the visual noise of a full grid. This style includes plenty of white space while still helping the user keep their place while reading. This style is the most common and recommended for all data set sizes.

</p>

<p style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans', 'Lucida Sans Regular', 'Lucida Grande', 'Lucida Sans Unicode', Geneva, Verdana, sans-serif">2. Use Clear Contrast
  Establish hierarchy by adding contrast to your table. This can be done with different text styles and backgrounds.
Header Contrast: Differentiate header text from column text by changing the weight and color. Applying a different color background to the header can provide additional contrast if desired.
Column data: Column data can also use different weights and colors to emphasize certain data like the row identifier (first column) or a primary data point in a single cell (ie. cell data: 1,234 34%).

  
</p>3. Add Visual Cues
Use different colored backgrounds to add organizational context and meaning to your table. These visual cues help present the data in a way that is easier to scan and understand.
Row Background: Change the color of an entire row to highlight a difference in the domain of data (ie. switching between single values and sums or averages).
Cell Background: Change the color of a cell to highlight the status of a data point (ie. trending up, trending down).

<p style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans', 'Lucida Sans Regular', 'Lucida Grande', 'Lucida Sans Unicode', Geneva, Verdana, sans-serif">
  4. Align Columns Properly
  By default, most column data is left aligned. This helps make the data easily scannable, readable and comparable. The one exception is numeric data related to size. These numbers should be right aligned to help users identify number size.


  Rules to follow:
Align textual data to the left (ie. Name)
Align numeric data not related to size (ie. date, zip code, phone number)
Align numeric data related to size (ie. count, percent)
Align headers according to their column data
</p>
<p style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans', 'Lucida Sans Regular', 'Lucida Grande', 'Lucida Sans Unicode', Geneva, Verdana, sans-serif">
  5. Use Tabular Numerals
Use a tabular (or monospaced) font when displaying numbers. This means, rather than having proportional spacing (ie. “W” is wider than “I”), each figure is the same width. This makes columns of numerical data easier to scan.
For your table, you can use an inherently monospaced font (ie. Courier, Courier New, Lucida Console, Monaco, ect.) or the monospaced numeric set sometimes included with proportional fonts.

 Choose an Appropriate Line Height
Choose a line height most appropriate for the type and amount of data in your table. Regular and relaxed row heights offer more white space, and are more comfortable for reading large data sets. Using a condensed row height will allow the user to view more data at once without having to scroll, but will reduce the table’s readability and potentially cause parsing errors.

Row heights
Condensed: 40px
Regular: 48px
Relaxed: 56px
</p>
<p style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans', 'Lucida Sans Regular', 'Lucida Grande', 'Lucida Sans Unicode', Geneva, Verdana, sans-serif">
6. Include Enough Padding
Maintain a minimum of 16px padding on both the right and left of each column. This means the space between each column should total at least 32px.
</p>
<p style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans', 'Lucida Sans Regular', 'Lucida Grande', 'Lucida Sans Unicode', Geneva, Verdana, sans-serif">
  7. Use Subtext
Subtext can provide timely context and helpful details without taking up space or cluttering the table. It can also be used to combine columns.
For example, instead of having separate columns for user and email, the email can be added as subtext below the user’s name.

  1. User first
The primary aim of any user experience design process is to focus on the users during the entire product design and development process. It is clear from the term user experience design itself that it is centered around the users and is aimed to improve their experience. Hence, UX designers need to focus on what the users are looking for in a product and this can be done by conducting user research and testing. You should be careful about the fact that you are designing not for yourself, and user considerations and expectations should be the foremost priority of any UX design process.
It is important to consider that users of your product may or may not be having expectations and preferences just like yours. Hence, designers should refrain from projecting their assumptions and thinking on the users and recognize that users may have divergent needs and expectations from a product than what is assumed by them. Most likely, users will have different backgrounds, goals, mentalities, and mindsets. To gain insights regarding such aspects, designers employ usability testing procedures that give them accurate feedback regarding the users.
